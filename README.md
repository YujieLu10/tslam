# Tactile Slam

This repo is forked from github.com/aravindr93/mjrl

## Installation

You should create a new conda environment and do `pip install -e .`. Details refering to [here](./setup/README.md)

## NOTEs

1. `trajopt` is a library referred multiple times by this repo. However, the original codebase for this project cannot sucessfully import components in `trajopt`.
Thus, I ignore the installation of `trajopt`.

2. To install `trajopt`, refer to [rllab site at UCB](https://rll.berkeley.edu/trajopt/doc/sphinx_build/html/install.html)
